# LDS
Lane Detection System
this repositary is a contribution to an already existent project made by udacity courses as I knew but I took the the project 
from this repositary :
https://github.com/nourmed/self-driving-car/tree/master/project_4_advanced_lane_finding

I just replaced the main class with this classes :
  1- liveCam.py : streams live result from a webcam 
  2- LiveVideo.py : streams live result from a static Video 
  3- writeVideo.py : same job as the previous main.py class
